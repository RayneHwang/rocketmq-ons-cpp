## Overview
Apache RocketMQ ONS is a RocketMQ lightweight client.      
As a high-level client, ONS is more simple and easy to use than native clients. It shields the underlying implementation details and provides a better abstraction. It also removes admin interfaces used for resource management. Therefore, for most RocketMQ users, ONS can be used to access the RocketMQ service faster, and the code is more concise and secure.
